injectso
========

Injecting DSO's since 2001. Inside `attic` folder you will find code that was needed for my
*Adventures in heap-cloning* paper, which is not longer supported.

You most likely want to check the [contrib](https://github.com/stealth/injectso/tree/master/contrib) folder on how to use `LuaJIT` like frida.
Changing of hooked function parameters is not yet supported and so is no other arch than `x86_64`.
I made the patch as clear and isolated as possible, so anything could easily added though.
